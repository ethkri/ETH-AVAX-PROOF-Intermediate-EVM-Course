# Solidity Error Handling

This Solidity program provides a comprehensive demonstration of error handling using assert, require, and revert functions. These fundamental features of the Solidity programming language play a crucial role in enforcing constraints and managing errors within smart contracts.

## Overview

Solidity utilizes assert, require, and revert for error control. This program serves as an educational resource, explaining the functionality and significance of these error-handling mechanisms. It serves as a foundation for developers seeking to understand and implement effective error control strategies in their smart contracts.

## Getting Started

### Running the Program

To execute this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the Remix website: [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., error.sol).

3. Copy and paste the code from the provided error.sol into the editor.

4. In the "Solidity Compiler" tab, ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.21" or another compatible version. Click on "Compile error.sol."

5. Deploy the contract by navigating to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Select the "error" contract from the dropdown menu and click "Deploy."

6. Interact with the contract by calling functions such as contribute, addMember, and changeOwner. Click on the "error" contract in the left-hand sidebar, select the desired function, and click "transact" to execute.
